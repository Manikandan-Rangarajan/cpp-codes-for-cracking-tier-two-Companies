This C++ program implements the Merge Sort algorithm, a popular and efficient sorting technique based on the "divide and conquer" strategy. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. Headers and Namespace
The program includes the <bits/stdc++.h> header, which is a catch-all header file that includes almost every standard C++ library.
The using namespace std; directive is used to avoid prefixing standard library names with std::.
2. Merge Function
Purpose: The merge function combines two sorted halves of an array into a single sorted array.
Parameters:
arr: The array to be sorted.
left, mid, right: Indices that define the boundaries of the two subarrays to be merged.
Process:
The function first creates two temporary vectors, leftarr and rightarr, to hold the elements of the left and right subarrays, respectively.
It then copies the corresponding elements from the main array into these vectors.
Two pointers i and j are used to track the current elements in leftarr and rightarr. The k pointer tracks the position in the original array.
The function merges the two subarrays by comparing elements from leftarr and rightarr, placing the smaller element back into the original array.
If there are remaining elements in either leftarr or rightarr, they are copied back into the original array.
3. Merge Sort Function
Purpose: The mergeSort function recursively divides the array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges them back together.
Parameters:
arr: The array to be sorted.
left, right: The indices marking the current segment of the array to be sorted.
Process:
The function checks if left is less than right, ensuring there's more than one element to sort.
It calculates the midpoint mid and recursively calls mergeSort on the left and right halves.
After sorting the two halves, it merges them using the merge function.
4. Main Function
Input:
The user is prompted to enter the size of the array (n) and then the elements of the array.
Sorting:
The mergeSort function is called to sort the array.
Output:
The sorted array is printed to the console.
