Variable Declaration and Input:

int i, n, mis, count, tot;
cout << "Enter a Number(should be n-1):: " << endl;
cin >> n;
int arr[n];
cout << "Enter the array elements (1 to n, with one missing):  " << endl;
for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> arr[i];
}
Variables:
n: Represents the number of elements in the array (which should be one less than the total sequence length).
arr[n]: An array of size n where the user will input the elements.
tot: This will hold the sum of the first n+1 natural numbers.
count: This will accumulate the sum of the array elements.
mis: Will store the missing number after calculation.
User Input:
The user is prompted to enter the value of n.
The user is then asked to input n elements into the array, which should be the numbers from 1 to n+1 with one missing.

Calculate the Total Sum of First n+1 Natural Numbers:

tot = ((n+1)*(n+2))/2;
This line calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to n+1 using the formula:

Sum= (n+1)×(n+2)/2
​
 
The formula calculates what the sum of the sequence would be if no numbers were missing.

Calculate the Sum of Array Elements:

for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    count += arr[i];
}
This loop iterates through the array, summing all the values the user input.
The result is stored in the variable count.

Determine the Missing Number:

mis = tot - count;
The missing number is calculated by subtracting the sum of the array elements (count) from the total sum of the first n+1 natural numbers (tot).
Since tot represents the sum of the full sequence, the difference will give the missing number.

Output the Missing Number:

cout << mis << " iss the missing number in the arrray" << endl;
The program outputs the missing number.
